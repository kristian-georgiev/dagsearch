# dagsearch
Fuzzy search in forwards citations for academic papers using the Semantic Scholar Rest API


### Development Workflow:
#### Getting started:
- clone the repo
- run ```$ npm install```
#### Debugging:
- run ```$ npm start``` and look at http://localhost:3000/ (hard refresh if needed)
#### Committing:
- make sure you're not commiting node modules (the .gitignore file should take care of this automatically)
